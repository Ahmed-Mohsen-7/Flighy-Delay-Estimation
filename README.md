# Flighy-Delay-Estimation
This project applies different Machine Learning algorithms to solve flight delay forecasting problem. The following steps have been implemented:
- Data preprocessing: feature engineering, lable encoding, data splitting, and feature scaling
- Outlier detection
- ML models: linear regression, polynomial regression, and lasso regularization

The **colab file** contains the code implementation along with inline comments. The **pdf report** provides a brief description about the data and a concise explanation about the ML algorithms. First, Preprocessing data is explained which includes data splitting, outlier detection, and extracting some additional feature such as flight duration. Second, different approaches were implemented like Linear Regression, Multi Linear
Regression, and Polynomial Regression. Also, Lasso was used as Regularization technique to
prevent overfitting. At the end of report, results are be shown and discussed along with some comments
about the data itself.

This project was part of my Machine Learning algorithm by professor Adil Khan, Innopolis University 2022.
